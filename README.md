# Heap Efficiency Comparison
*(project by Cocu Matei-Iulian & LÄƒutaru Bianca-Maria)*

This project goes over the comparison between the Binomial Heap and the Rank-Pairing Heap, in terms of efficiency in various different contexts and the importance of operation-optimizations.

## 1. Introduction

This documentation will go through the actual implementations of all components of this project and the ideas behind them; the classes used in the heap applications are kept separate, each having its header file (`binomial_heap.h` and `rank_pairing_heap.h`), while the query generator is defined in the `query_generator.h` file.

## 2. Query Generator

The generator's primary aim is to have a *weighted decision based system* so that the numbers printed could correlate with each other in necessary circumstances. This outlines the seven arguments required for `generate_test_file`, the *main function* that is in charge of query creation.

To put it another way, the last four arguments indicate the percentage of a **type** of operation to be called for, while the first three arguments are intended for the *name of the generated file*, the number of *maximum possible heaps that can be built* from the queries, and the *actual number of queries* contained by the file.

For the *randomness* effect of the numbers selected to be written, the implementation utilises the `<random>` library, available after **C++11**, by importing the **Mersenne Twister 19937** generator `(mt19937)`, an instantiation of `mersenne_twister_engine`; function `int rand_num(int low, int high)` is defined, taking as arguments both (lower and upper) bounds of the number that is to be "picked".

Diving into the functionality of the main loop of this main function for query generation,


## 3. Binomial Heap

### 3.1. Description

A *binomial heap* is a data structure that acts as a priority queue. It is an example of a mergeable / meldable heap, as it supports merging two heaps in logarithmic time.

A binomial heap is implemented as a set of *binomial trees*, which are defined recursively as follows:
- A binomial tree of order `0` is a single node
- A binomial tree of order `k` has a root node whose children are roots of binomial trees of orders `k-1`, `k-2`, ..., `2`, `1`, `0` (in this order).

A *binomial tree* of order `k` has the following properties:
- It has exactly `2`<sup>`k`</sup> nodes.
- It has a depth of `k`.
- Each binomial tree in a heap obeys the minimum-heap property: the key of a node is greater than or equal to the key of its parent.
- There can be at most one binomial tree for each order, including zero order.

A binomial heap with `n` nodes has the number of binomial trees equal to the number of set bits in the *binary representation* of `n`. We can relate the degree of these binomial trees with the positions of set bits. With this relation, we can conclude that there are `O(log n)` Binomial Trees in a Binomial Heap with `n` nodes.

|:-----------------:|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:----:|:--------:|:-----------------:|:---------------------:|:-------------:|

*where n is the number of nodes and k is the length of the interval*

### 3.3. Implementation

#### 3.3.1. Structure

The implementation of the Binomial Heap is encapsulated in two classes:

**`BiNode`** - represents a node in a binomial tree:
- `value`: The key or value of the node.
- `parent`: A pointer to its parent.
- `children`: A list of pointers to its child nodes.
- `degree`: The order of the node.

**`BinomialHeap`** - represents the heap as a collection of binomial trees:  
- `trees`: A vector of roots of binomial trees.
- `min_node`: Pointer to the node with the minimum value.
- `total`: Count of total elements in the heap.

#### 3.3.2. Operations:

- ***find-min*** - `heap.min_node`: a pointer to the node with the minimum value is stored in the heap at all times.

- ***insert*** - `insert(value)`: inserts a new value by creating a single-node heap and merging it into the current heap.

- ***delete*** - `delete_value(value)`: locates a node with the given value, assigns it the lowest possible value, bubbles it up to the root and then removes the root using the `extract_min` function.

- ***find*** - `find_value(value)`: iterates through the roots of all binomial trees and performs a recursive depth-first search with the helper function `find_in_tree`.

- ***meld*** - `merge(other)`: combines another binomial heap into the current one by appending all trees from the other heap into the current heap's tree list. It then updates the total node count and calls `consolidate()` to ensure that the binomial heap properties are maintained.

- ***largest less than*** - `max_less_than(value)` and ***smallest greater than*** - `min_more_than(value)`: traverse all nodes to find the values.

- ***sort interval*** - `get_sorted_in_range(x, y)`: collects all values in the specified range and sorts them.
